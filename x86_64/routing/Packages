Description:  Ahcpd is a daemon for configuring an IPv6 network using the Ad-Hoc
 Configuration Protocol (AHCP).  AHCP is designed for wireless mesh
 networks, where IPv6 autoconfiguration and DHCPv6 do not work, but may
 also be used on wired networks.

Description:  BIRD is an internet routing daemon which manages TCP/IP routing tables
 with support of modern routing protocols, easy to use configuration
 interface and powerful route filtering language. It is lightweight and
 efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers.
 
 This packages the legacy v1.6 branch of Bird, which splits IPv4 and IPv6
 support into separate binaries. See also the bird2 package for the newer
 branch which integrates support for both IP protocols in a single binary.
 
 This is IPv4 version of BIRD, it supports OSPFv2, RIPv2 and BGP
 protocols.
 
 In BGP, BIRD supports communities, multiprotocol extensions, MD5
 authentication, 32bit AS numbers and could act as a route server or a
 route reflector. BIRD also supports multiple RIBs, multiple kernel
 routing tables and redistribution between the protocols with a powerful
 configuration syntax.
